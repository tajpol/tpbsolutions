      <br>
        
      <h2>Building Digital Systems That Drive Results</h2>
      
      <p>With 7+ years of hands-on experience in e-commerce operations, frontend development, and digital strategy, I help businesses and creators build efficient online systems that actually convert. My approach combines technical execution with merchandising strategy—because the best digital experiences understand both the code and the customer.</p>
      
      <br><br><br>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>

      <br>
      
      <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>E-Commerce Operations</strong><br>
              I manage multichannel selling ecosystems across Shopify, Etsy, Gumroad, eBay, and Amazon KDP. From product listings and SKU maintenance to pricing strategy and conversion optimization, I handle the operational details that keep digital storefronts running smoothly. My work has driven measurable results—including a 57% increase in eBay sales through optimized product content and an 88% reduction in fulfillment costs through streamlined processes.
          </li>

          <br>
          
          <li>
              <strong>Frontend Development</strong><br>
              I design and build responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern CMS platforms. Whether it's improving product discovery through better UX, restructuring navigation for mobile users, or refining checkout flows, I create web experiences that serve both business goals and user needs.
          </li>

          <br>
          
          <li>
              <strong>Digital Marketing & Content</strong><br>
              I develop SEO-optimized content strategies, manage affiliate partnerships, and create social media plans that reach real audiences organically. I've built affiliate streams with tech and crypto brands while growing Instagram reach to 260+ accounts and 639 views in 30 days—no paid ads required.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <br><br>

      <h2>Why This Works</h2>

      <br>
      
      <p>My background bridges creative training from the Art Institute of Chicago with real-world technical and merchandising experience. This means I can:</p>

      <br>
      
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Execute Technically:</strong> Write clean code, manage Git workflows, and integrate tools like Google Analytics, Framer, and Notion into daily operations</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Think Commercially:</strong> Understand pricing strategy, competitor research, marketplace algorithms, and what actually drives conversions</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Design Holistically:</strong> Consider brand identity, user experience, and visual presentation as interconnected parts of digital success</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Work Independently:</strong> Manage full project lifecycles from concept through launch and optimization</li>
      </ul>

      <br><br>

      <h2>Who I Work With</h2>

      <br>
      
      <p>I'm passionate about supporting:</p>

      <br>
      
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Independent Creators & Artists:</strong> Musicians, authors, and makers who need efficient digital infrastructure to sell their work</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Small E-Commerce Brands:</strong> Businesses looking to scale across multiple platforms while maintaining quality and consistency</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Luxury & Lifestyle Brands:</strong> Companies where aesthetics and user experience are as important as functionality</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Self-Publishers & Digital Product Creators:</strong> Entrepreneurs managing catalogs across Amazon KDP, Gumroad, and other digital marketplaces</li>
      </ul>

      <br><br>

      <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>

      <br>
      
      <p>Every project starts with understanding your specific goals, audience, and constraints. From there, I deliver:</p>

      <br>
      
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Results-Oriented Work:</strong> Focused on metrics that matter—conversions, organic reach, cost efficiency, and user engagement</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Clean Execution:</strong> Well-structured code, organized catalogs, and systems that are easy to maintain and scale</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Direct Communication:</strong> No jargon, no runaround—just clear updates and collaborative problem-solving</li>

          <br>
          
          <li><strong>Full Ownership:</strong> From product photography and metadata optimization to site deployment and analytics setup, I handle end-to-end implementation</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
    
      <p>Whether you need multichannel e-commerce management, a custom website, or strategic support for launching digital products, I bring both the technical skills and commercial understanding to make it happen.</p>
